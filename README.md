# StafirLCD - Arduino library
Arudino library for displaying Icelandic characters on a
Liquid Crystal Display.

You can display up to 8 specaial characters on a LCD display.
So, I drew all the icelandic characters and made a function
useChars to allow you to select which characters you want to
display on the LCD screen.  For the next screen you can call
this function again to display different characters for another 
screen.

Use the function print to print an icelandic characters onto
the LCD screen.
